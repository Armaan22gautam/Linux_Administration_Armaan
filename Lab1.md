**Experiment 1:** Use the touch command to create sets of empty practice files
to use during this lab. In each set, replace X with the numbers
1 through 6. Create six files with names of the form
songX.mp3, snapX.jpg, filmX.avi. Create three subdirectories
for organizing your files, and name the
subdirectories friends, family, and work. Use a single
command to create all three subdirectories at the same time
